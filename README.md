# To-Do List Application

## Overview
This project is a simple and functional To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, check off, delete, and filter tasks based on their completion status. The tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring that they persist even when the page is refreshed.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Mark as Done:** Clicking on a task marks it as completed, and a strikethrough effect is applied.
- **Delete Tasks:** Users can delete tasks by clicking on the "x" button.
- **Filter Options:** Dropdown menu provides filtering options:
  - Show all tasks
  - Show only checked (completed) tasks
  - Show only unchecked (pending) tasks
- **Data Persistence:** Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage to ensure persistence across page reloads.
